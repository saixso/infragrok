Send keys.\n\n`POST /diagnostics?prompt_id=diagnose` → Registry → Factory → Prompt\n\nWhy:\n- Prompts evolve without API changes\n- No prompt injection risk\n- Client code never changes\n- Prompt engineers edit markdown, not deployments\n\nStrategy Pattern + Registry = prompts as content, not code.\n\n[network-triage-ai-agent](https://github.com/SpotOnInc/network-triage-ai-agent)",
